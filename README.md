# NumPy Data Analysis Mini Projects

This repository contains two mini projects focused on practicing **NumPy for real-world data analysis** using vectorized operations, boolean masking, and statistical reasoning.

## 📌 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Advertising Data Analysis
**Dataset:** Advertising campaign data (TV, Radio, Newspaper vs Sales)

**Key Analysis Performed:**
- Statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation)
- Handling missing values using NumPy
- Identifying high-performing and inefficient campaigns
- Detecting sales outliers using a 2σ statistical rule
- Evaluating combined TV and Radio impact on sales

**Key Insight:**
> Campaigns with above-average TV and Radio spending achieved significantly higher average sales compared to the overall average.

### 2️⃣ IPL Batting Performance Analysis
**Dataset:** IPL batting statistics

**Key Analysis Performed:**
- Player consistency and reliability analysis
- Identification of high-impact and inefficient batters
- Batting efficiency analysis using runs per ball
- Outlier detection using statistical thresholds
- Min–max normalization of numerical features for ML readiness

**Key Insight:**
> Players with above-median strike rate and above-median run totals score more than twice the runs of an average IPL batter.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
3. Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
These projects were built to strengthen **NumPy fundamentals**, data analysis thinking, and statistical reasoning without relying on high-level libraries like Pandas.
